We use the YOLOv8 pose model to detect general object categories, such as bollards. Given that YOLOâ€™s classification performance on small objects has not been the best, we further process the detected objects using a ResNet model, implemented in PyTorch, to classify them based on country-specific categories. In this workflow, the YOLO model classifies the object as "bollard", while the ResNet model handles the country-level classification.

Our repository provides trained models; however, the dataset is not publicly available. If you wish to train the models on your own dataset, please refer to `build_model.ipynb`, which contains the necessary training scripts. This notebook allows you to use your own data by simply adjusting the file paths in the training functions. Although it includes a script to download data from an AWS S3 bucket, this is optional if your data is already locally available. Additionally, the notebook offers a script to convert standard YOLO annotations into YOLO pose annotations. If your annotations are in the standard YOLO format, this conversion is required to use the pose model.
